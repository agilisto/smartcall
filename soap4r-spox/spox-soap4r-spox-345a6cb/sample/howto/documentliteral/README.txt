To use the sample service in this directory;

1. run ../../../bin/wsdl2ruby.rb:
  $ wsdl2ruby.rb --wsdl echo.wsdl --type server --type client --force

2. replace the file defaultServant.rb with the file servant.rb in this
  directory.  the file defaultServant.rb is generated by wsdl2ruby.rb in the
  previous step.

3. replace the file echoServiceClient.rb with the file client.rb in this
  directory.  the file echoServiceClient.rb is generated by wsdl2ruby.rb, too.

4. run echoService.rb:
  $ ruby echoService.rb

  echoService.rb is the server program.  hit Ctrl-C to stop the server.

5. run echoServiceClient.rb in another terminal:
  $ ruby echoServiceClient.rb http://localhost:10080
