The files:
hwsClient.rb
default.rb
defaultDriver.rb

were generated by applying wsdl2ruby.rb to hws.wsdl

The hws.wsdl file was written to describe the server
hw_s.rb in the /helloworld/server directory. 
Please note that the namespace declaration in hw_s.rb is
the same as the name space delaration in hws.wsdl.  You
cannot make the client will generate an error if the namespace
used in the client differs from the namespace in the server.
