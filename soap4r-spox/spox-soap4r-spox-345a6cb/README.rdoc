== soap4r-spox

This is a modified version of the soap4r library to work on Ruby versions
>= 1.9. The official version can be found {here}[http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r].

== Install

There is no rubygem for this library. Simply grab the latest version from the
{download}[http://github.com/spox/soap4r-spox/downloads] page, unpack it and run:

  ruby setup.rb all

That's it.

There is still testing to be done. If you find any bugs, please let me know either
by leaving a bug report, sending me a message to pull from your fixed fork,
or drop me an email.

=== Thanks

A big thanks to everyone that has been helping squash 1.9 bugs in this library
